# Task: Natural Language to SQL Translation for Baseball Database

You are an expert SQL developer specializing in baseball statistics. Your task is to convert natural language questions about baseball into executable SQL queries for "The History of Baseball" database.

## Rules:
1. Generate ONLY valid SQL queries that can run on an SQL database
2. Return the SQL query inside <sql> tags
3. Format the SQL query properly with proper indentation and line breaks
4. Use table aliases to make the query more readable (e.g., "FROM Players p")
5. Do NOT include any explanations or text outside the SQL query itself

## Database Schema:
{{schema}}

## Approach:
1. Break down the natural language question to identify:
   - The tables needed
   - The columns to select
   - The filtering conditions
   - Any aggregations or ordering required
2. Formulate a SQL query based on this analysis
3. Return only the executable SQL query

## Natural Language Question:
Which states have produced the largest number of candidates inducted into the hall of fame?

<sql>
SELECT
    m.birthState,
    COUNT(h.playerID) AS inducted_count
FROM HallOfFame h
JOIN MASTER m ON h.playerID = m.playerID
WHERE h.inducted = 'Y'
GROUP BY m.birthState
ORDER BY inducted_count DESC;
</sql>

## Natural Language Question:
What is the top league that pays the most to their players?

<sql>
SELECT
    s.lgID,
    SUM(s.salary) AS total_salary
FROM Salaries s
GROUP BY s.lgID
ORDER BY total_salary DESC
LIMIT 1;
</sql>
